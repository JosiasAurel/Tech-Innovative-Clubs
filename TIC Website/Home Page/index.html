        <p class="paragraph"> The <strong>Tech Innovative Clubs</strong> is a non profit which aims at empowering
        secondary school students to solve problems in their community using technology.
        After realizing how gift-given some Cameroonian youths are, but lack the exposure necessary
        for the growth of their skills, the Tech Innovative Clubs, being the first organization to
        organize project competitions for secondary school students, has brought in the platform
        essential for the growth of Cameroonian youths. </p>

        <h4 class="body-heading">About Us</h4>
        
        <p class="paragraph">The initiative was brought up by Mr Bill Agha, a computer science
            teacher in Cameroon. The ever first edition of the Tech Innovative Clubs was 
            in 2019 at Lyc√©e Bilingue d'Application. Bill Agha organized the competition to
            encourage his students who had talents in programming and electronics.
            From the success of the competition, he decided to make it the next year 
            but his projects were plagued by the Covid-19 Pandemic. During the academic year 2020/2021 
            most of the talented students of Bill changed school and some went to other regions.
            At this point, while loking for away to link everyone in Cameroon to the competition, 
            he organized the TIC SUMMIT which is the first national tech competition for seconodary school students.
